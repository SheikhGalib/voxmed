## Phase 7: Collaborative Care (✅ Completed)

| Task | Status | Date | Notes |
|------|--------|------|-------|
| Collaborative Hub (doctor messenger list) | ✅ | 2026-06-01 | `CollaborativeHubScreen` — search, specialty filter chips, peer doctor list; tap → chat |

| Patient profile sharing in chat | ✅ | 2026-06-01 | "Share Patient" button in chat sends a patient card bubble; tap → `PatientDetailScreen` |
| Transfer Patient dialog | ✅ | 2026-06-01 | Informational dialog; full DB-level transfer requires schema update (see DB notes below) |
| `CollaborationRepository` | ✅ | 2026-06-01 | `listPeerDoctors`, `getOrCreateChatSession`, `sendMessage`, `getMessages` |
| Collaboration tests | ✅ | 2026-06-01 | 13 tests in `test/collaboration_test.dart` — colors, routes, RenewalStatus, repo instantiation |
| Consultation sessions + realtime chat | ✅ | 2026-04-07 | Session and message data connected to UI |
| Specialist invitation flow | ⏳ | | Invitation workflow pending |
| Shared patient data view | ✅ | 2026-04-07 | Collaborative hub shows live consultation content |
| **Run migration 004 in Supabase** | ✅ | 2026-04-25 | `supabase/migrations/004_doctor_chat_realtime.sql` — nullable patient_id, message_type column, Realtime publication |
| **Fix: consultation_sessions RLS (chicken-and-egg)** | ✅ | 2026-04-25 | Migration `005_fix_chat_session_rls.sql` — restores `created_by IN (...)` to SELECT policy so INSERT+select-back works before members exist |
| **Fix: sender_id FK violation in messages** | ✅ | 2026-04-25 | `doctor_chat_screen.dart` — `sender_id` now uses `supabase.auth.currentUser!.id` (= `profiles.id`) instead of `doctors.id`; `isMe` check also fixed |
| **Fix: hardcoded error message in chat screen** | ✅ | 2026-04-25 | Error widget now shows `e.toString()` instead of static DB migration hint |
| Supabase Realtime on consultation_messages | ✅ | 2026-04-25 | `REPLICA IDENTITY FULL` + publication; `.stream()` in Flutter delivers true push chat |
| **Fix: message persistence broken — duplicate sessions per doctor pair** | ✅ | 2026-04-25 | Root cause: `getOrCreateChatSession()` used a cross-membership query (`.eq('doctor_id', otherDoctorId)`) that `members_select` RLS always stripped to 0 rows — each doctor opened a new separate session, so neither could see the other's messages. Fix: replaced with single title-based lookup on `consultation_sessions` (title is deterministic; `sessions_select` correctly lets any member see the session). File: `lib/repositories/collaboration_repository.dart` |
| **Migration 008: deduplicate sessions + UNIQUE title constraint** | ✅ | 2026-04-25 | Deletes orphaned duplicate `dr_chat:` sessions left by the broken lookup, then adds `UNIQUE(title)` to `consultation_sessions` to prevent race-condition duplicates. File: `supabase/migrations/008_deduplicate_sessions.sql` |
| **Fix: recursion persists — nuclear RLS reset (migration 007)** | ✅ | 2026-04-25 | Migration `007_nuclear_rls_reset.sql` — drops ALL policies on the 3 tables, introduces `get_my_doctor_id()` SECURITY DEFINER helper to resolve `doctors.id` outside the RLS evaluation loop, rewrites all 6 policies with a strictly one-way dependency graph; also fixes `sessions_insert` (enforces `created_by = get_my_doctor_id()`) and `messages_insert` (adds `sender_id = auth.uid()` guard) |

> **⚠️ ACTION REQUIRED — Run migration 007:**
> Run `supabase/migrations/007_nuclear_rls_reset.sql` in the Supabase SQL Editor.
> This supersedes migrations 004–006 for the RLS policies on `consultation_sessions`, `consultation_members`, and `consultation_messages`. The schema changes (nullable columns, Realtime publication, message_type column) from migration 004 are still valid and do not need to be re-run.
>
> **Ambiguities found and fixed in migration 007 vs. the original draft:**
> 1. `sessions_insert` was `get_my_doctor_id() IS NOT NULL` (only checked "are you a doctor") — changed to `created_by = get_my_doctor_id()` to prevent `created_by` spoofing.
> 2. `messages_insert` was missing `sender_id = auth.uid()` — any session member could insert a message with another doctor's UUID as the sender; now enforced at DB level.

> **DB Changes completed (migrations 004 → 007):**
> 1. `consultation_sessions.patient_id` is now **NULLABLE** — doctor-to-doctor chats work without a patient context.
> 2. `consultation_sessions.created_by` is now **NULLABLE** — guard against schema drift.
> 3. `consultation_messages.message_type` column added (`text` | `patient_share`).
> 4. `prescriptions` RLS allows doctor INSERT.
> 5. `consultation_messages` added to `supabase_realtime` publication with `REPLICA IDENTITY FULL`.
> 6. `get_my_doctor_id()` SECURITY DEFINER function created — breaks RLS evaluation cycle.
> 7. All 6 policies on the 3 chat tables rewritten with non-recursive, one-way dependency graph.

## Cross-Platform: Shared Database (voxmed + voxmedweb)

> **Context:** The Flutter app and the React web management dashboard use the same Supabase project (`jedgnisrjwemhazherro`). RLS bugs in one app affect the other.

| Task | Status | Date | Notes |
|------|--------|------|-------|
| Identify shared database between Flutter app and web dashboard | ✅ | 2026-04-24 | Same Supabase project; `user_role` enum covers all 6 roles |
| Update `database_schema.md` to reflect actual cloud schema | ✅ | 2026-04-24 | Added `hospital_staff` table, `hospital_status`/`doctor_status` enums, approval fields on `doctors` and `hospitals`, updated architecture overview |
| Diagnose doctor-not-appearing-for-approval bug | ✅ | 2026-04-24 | Root cause: missing INSERT RLS policy on `doctors` for authenticated users — see `docs/rls_fix_doctor_visibility.md` |
| Create fix doc for RLS issue | ✅ | 2026-04-24 | `docs/rls_fix_doctor_visibility.md` — full root cause analysis, fix SQL, verification steps |
| Create migration `002_fix_rls_policies.sql` | ✅ | 2026-04-24 | At `voxmedweb/supabase/migrations/002_fix_rls_policies.sql` |
| Apply RLS fix in Supabase cloud | ✅ | 2026-04-24 | Migration applied — hospital dashboard now shows doctors |
| Fix stale "Approval Pending" after sign-in (Flutter) | ✅ | 2026-04-24 | `currentDoctorProvider` now watches `authStateProvider` — auto-invalidates on sign-in/out |
| Fix `is_available` column mismatch in doctor_schedules (web) | ✅ | 2026-04-24 | Renamed to `is_active` in server Zod schema |
| Fix `max_patients` column not found in doctor_schedules (web) | ✅ | 2026-04-24 | Renamed to `slot_duration_minutes` in server + client form |
| Fix ON CONFLICT error when saving doctor schedule (web) | ✅ | 2026-04-25 | Replaced `.upsert()` with select-then-update-or-insert; created migration `003` for DB constraint |
| Create migration `003_add_doctor_schedules_unique_constraint.sql` | ⚠️ | 2026-04-25 | **ACTION REQUIRED** — run in Supabase SQL Editor to add `UNIQUE(doctor_id, day_of_week)` |
| Write Flutter scheduling unit tests | ✅ | 2026-04-25 | `test/scheduling_test.dart` — 12 tests covering fromJson, toJson, day names, slot count |
| Write web scheduling unit tests | ✅ | 2026-04-25 | `server/src/test/scheduling.test.js` — 21 tests covering Zod schema, slot count, upsert logic |

### ⚠️ Supabase Action Required — Doctor Schedules Unique Constraint

Run the contents of `voxmedweb/supabase/migrations/003_add_doctor_schedules_unique_constraint.sql` in the **Supabase SQL Editor**:

1. Open https://supabase.com/dashboard → project `jedgnisrjwemhazherro`
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor → New query**
3. Paste and run the migration

This adds `UNIQUE(doctor_id, day_of_week)` to `doctor_schedules`. The server already works without it (select-then-update-or-insert), but the constraint provides database-level enforcement as a safety net.

| **Fix register screen not showing / back button broken** | ✅ | 2026-04-22 | **Root cause:** `_GoRouterRefreshStream` (in `app_router.dart`) fired on every Supabase auth event (token refreshes, initial state loads) — not just real login/logout changes. GoRouter's `refreshListenable` re-runs the redirect and internally calls `go()` to re-navigate, wiping the push-navigation back stack. After `context.push('/register')`, the stack `[login, register]` was instantly replaced with `[register]` alone, so `context.pop()` had nothing to pop. **Fix 1:** `_GoRouterRefreshStream` now tracks `_prevHasSession` and only calls `notifyListeners()` when the session null→non-null state actually changes. **Fix 2:** Login screen navigation changed from `context.push(AppRoutes.register)` to `context.go(AppRoutes.register)` (correct for auth flows). **Fix 3:** Register screen back button and "Sign In" link changed from `context.pop()` to `context.go(AppRoutes.login)` — deterministic regardless of back-stack state. Files: `app_router.dart`, `login_screen.dart`, `register_screen.dart`. |

| **RLS policy for `medical_records` INSERT** | 🔧 | 2026-04-10 | **Requires SQL in Supabase** — see below |
| **Storage bucket `reports` creation** | 🔧 | 2026-04-10 | **Requires SQL in Supabase** — see below |

### ⚠️ Supabase Actions Required

Run the following SQL in the **Supabase SQL Editor** to fix the RLS violation on record upload:

```sql
-- 1. Ensure RLS is enabled on medical_records
ALTER TABLE medical_records ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- 2. Create INSERT policy for patients (if not already present)
DO $$
BEGIN
  IF NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'medical_records' AND policyname = 'Patients insert own records'
  ) THEN
    CREATE POLICY "Patients insert own records" ON medical_records
      FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (patient_id = auth.uid());
  END IF;
END $$;

-- 3. Ensure the reports storage bucket exists
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public)
  VALUES ('reports', 'reports', true)
  ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;

-- 4. Storage policy: allow authenticated users to upload to their own folder
CREATE POLICY "Users upload own reports" ON storage.objects
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
    bucket_id = 'reports' AND
    auth.role() = 'authenticated' AND
    (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
  );

-- 5. Storage policy: allow authenticated users to read their own files
CREATE POLICY "Users read own reports" ON storage.objects
  FOR SELECT USING (
    bucket_id = 'reports' AND
    auth.role() = 'authenticated'
  );
```
